# Recursive object iteration
- In this project I am solving challenge "Beast 4. Creating libraries out of order" form Watch and Code course. 
- The idea is to create a function, which allows to load different libraries using just one global variable. 
In order to do it, I needed to learn how to recursively iterate object's properties and pass their values to a callback function.
